# pyhton-core-concepts
This repository covers all the core concepts of Python that I learned with great interest and enjoyment.
Each topic is explained in a simple, clear, and practical way — from basic syntax to object-oriented programming.
My goal is to make Python learning enjoyable, easy, and meaningful for everyone who visits this repo.
